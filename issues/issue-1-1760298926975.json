      "issue": "Potential for Resource Exhaustion/Denial of Service due to uncontrolled AI agent calls.",
      "location": "app/api/employees/performance/route.ts, lines 74-124 (for loop invoking PerformanceAgent)",
      "recommendation": "Implement a strict upper limit for the `limit` parameter (e.g., 50 or 100) before executing the Drizzle query. This will cap the number of expensive `PerformanceAgent.analyzeIndividual` calls made within a single request. Additionally, consider parallelizing the AI analysis calls using `Promise.all` with a concurrency limit or implementing batch processing for the `PerformanceAgent` if applicable, to prevent sequential bottlenecks."
    },
    {
      "severity": "medium",
      "category": "input_validation",
      "issue": "Insufficient input validation for `limit` and `offset` parameters.",
      "location": "app/api/employees/performance/route.ts, lines 24-25",
      "recommendation": "Add explicit validation to ensure `limit` and `offset` are positive integers and within acceptable ranges (e.g., `limit` must be `1 <= limit <= MAX_PAGE_SIZE`, `offset >= 0`). This prevents requesting an excessively large number of records, which, combined with the AI analysis, can exacerbate the DOS vulnerability."

      "issue": "Potential for invalid date processing if `dateFrom` parameter is malformed.",
      "location": "app/api/employees/performance/route.ts, line 32",
      "recommendation": "Validate the `dateFrom` parameter to ensure it is a valid date string before passing it to `new Date()`. For example, use a date parsing library or a regex to check the format."

  ],
  "conditions": [
    "Implement strict upper limit for the limit parameter (max 50-100)",
    "Add proper input validation for limit, offset, and dateFrom parameters",
    "Implement concurrency control or batch processing for PerformanceAgent calls",
    "Add rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks on the API endpoint"
  ],
  "reasoning": "While Agent 3 approved for Mizan compliance and the fix eliminates placeholders with a complete implementation, Agent 4 identified 3 security vulnerabilities including a HIGH severity DoS risk from uncontrolled AI agent calls. The potential for resource exhaustion through unlimited PerformanceAgent.analyzeIndividual calls in a loop makes this unsuitable for production deployment without security fixes."
