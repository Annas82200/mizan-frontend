# Frontend Cleanup Fixes - Build Error Resolution

## Date: October 13, 2025

## Issue
After the backend cleanup, the frontend build failed with the following error:
```
Type error: Cannot find module 'drizzle-orm/pg-core' or its corresponding type declarations.
./src/lib/schema/performance.ts:1:69
```

## Root Cause
The cleanup removed backend modules but left orphaned frontend files that:
1. Referenced deleted backend dependencies
2. Had API client methods pointing to deleted endpoints
3. Had navigation links to deleted pages

---

## ✅ FRONTEND FILES FIXED

### 1. **Deleted Orphaned Schema File**
- ❌ Deleted: `frontend/src/lib/schema/performance.ts`
  - This file tried to import `drizzle-orm/pg-core` (backend-only dependency)
  - Caused TypeScript compilation error
- ❌ Deleted: `frontend/src/lib/schema/` (entire empty directory)

### 2. **Deleted Skills Components**
- ❌ Deleted: `frontend/src/components/skills/ConversationalBOT.tsx`
- ❌ Deleted: `frontend/src/components/skills/` (entire directory)
  - Skills analysis was removed, so skills UI components are no longer needed

### 3. **Updated API Client** (`frontend/src/lib/api-client.ts`)
Removed API methods for deleted endpoints:
- ❌ Removed: `api.skills.*` - All skills analysis endpoints
- ❌ Removed: `api.performance.*` - Performance goals and reviews endpoints
- ❌ Removed: `api.hiring.*` - Hiring requisitions and candidates endpoints

- ✅ Kept: `api.superadmin.*` - Superadmin functions
- ✅ Kept: `api.employees.*` - Employee management

### 4. **Updated Dashboard Service** (`frontend/src/services/dashboard.service.ts`)
Removed service methods for deleted features:
- ❌ Removed: `socialMediaService.*` - Entire social media service
- ❌ Removed: `employeeService.getMySkills()` - Skills endpoints
- ❌ Removed: `employeeService.getLearningPaths()` - LXP endpoints

**Remaining services:**
- ✅ Kept: `superadminService.*` - All superadmin functions
- ✅ Kept: `adminService.*` - Admin dashboard and analysis functions
- ✅ Kept: `employeeService.*` - Employee dashboard and profile (minus skills/LXP)
- ✅ Kept: `commonService.*` - Shared utilities

### 5. **Updated Sidebar Navigation** (`frontend/src/components/dashboard/Sidebar.tsx`)
Removed navigation links to deleted pages:

**Superadmin Navigation:**
- ❌ Removed: Social Media link
- ❌ Removed: Skills module link
- ❌ Removed: Hiring module link  
- ❌ Removed: LXP module link
- ✅ Kept: Overview, Tenants, Demo Requests, Analytics
- ✅ Kept: Triggers, Framework, AI Training
- ✅ Kept: Modules → Structure, Culture, Performance (basic)
- ✅ Kept: Billing & Revenue, Settings

**Admin Navigation:**
- ❌ Removed: Skills link
- ❌ Removed: Performance link
- ❌ Removed: Hiring link
- ❌ Removed: LXP link
- ✅ Kept: Dashboard, Structure, Culture
- ✅ Kept: Team, Settings

**Employee Navigation:**
- ✅ Unchanged (no deleted features referenced)

### 6. **Updated Tenant Management Page** (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/superadmin/tenants/page.tsx`)
Updated tenant action buttons:
- ❌ Removed: "Manage Hiring" button
- ✅ Added: "View Structure Analysis" button (replaces hiring button)
- ✅ Kept: "View Structure Analysis" button
- ✅ Kept: "View Culture Analysis" button
