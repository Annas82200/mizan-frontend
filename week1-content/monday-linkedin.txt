Understanding Safety & Survival in Organizational Culture

In our seven-part series on the Mizan Framework, we begin with the foundation: Safety & Survival.

This first cylinder represents more than physical safety. It encompasses the psychological, emotional, and economic security that enables employees to bring their full selves to work.

Ethical Principle: Preservation of Life

Organizations that master Safety & Survival demonstrate:

• Psychological Safety - Team members feel safe to take risks, make mistakes, and voice opinions without fear of punishment or humiliation

• Economic Stability - Clear job security, fair compensation, and transparent career paths that reduce financial anxiety

• Physical Wellbeing - Comprehensive health and safety protocols, ergonomic workspaces, and respect for work-life boundaries

• Digital Security - Protection of personal data, clear privacy policies, and secure technology infrastructure

The Data-Driven Approach:

Research shows that organizations with high psychological safety scores experience:
- 47% higher employee retention rates
- 64% greater likelihood of innovation
- 27% reduction in turnover costs
- 12% increase in productivity

Key Enabling Values:
• Safety: Creating environments free from physical, psychological, and digital harm
