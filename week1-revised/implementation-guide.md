# Week 1 Revised Content Implementation Guide

## Overview
This revised Week 1 content strategy builds trust through personal storytelling before introducing the framework, following AGENT_CONTEXT_ULTIMATE.md guidelines.

## Content Strategy Shift

### Original Approach (Direct Framework Education)
- ❌ Started immediately with Cylinder 1 details
- ❌ Assumed audience understood non-hierarchical model
- ❌ Lacked personal connection
- ❌ No context for "why cylinders"

### Revised Approach (Trust → Context → Framework)
- ✅ Starts with personal story to build trust
- ✅ Explains revolutionary "cylinders not levels" concept
- ✅ Provides complete framework overview before deep dives
- ✅ Creates anticipation for 7-week journey
