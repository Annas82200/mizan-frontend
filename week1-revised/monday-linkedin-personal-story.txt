The Meeting That Changed Everything

Three years ago, I sat across from a CEO who had just lost his third VP of Engineering in 18 months. 

"We pay top dollar. We have great benefits. We're growing fast. Why can't we keep talent?" he asked.

As we dug deeper, a pattern emerged. It wasn't about compensation or perks. The organization was strong in some areas—innovation, growth targets, financial performance—but completely neglecting others: psychological safety, belonging, and meaning.

That's when it hit me: Organizations don't fail at one thing. They fail at balance.

Traditional thinking treats organizational development like levels to climb: 
Level 1: Get profitable
Level 2: Build culture
Level 3: Develop people
Level 4: Innovate

But what if that's backwards?

What if organizations need ALL these elements working simultaneously, like cylinders in an engine?

This realization led to three years of research, working with 50+ organizations, and ultimately, the Mizan Framework—a non-hierarchical approach to organizational health.

Over the next several weeks, I'll share what we learned. Not theory from textbooks, but real insights from real organizations facing real challenges.

The first insight might surprise you: The strongest companies don't climb levels. They strengthen cylinders.

What organizational challenge keeps you up at night?
