Three years ago, I sat across from a CEO who had just lost his third VP of Engineering in 18 months. 

"We pay top dollar. We have great benefits. We're growing fast. Why can't we keep talent?" he asked.

As we dug deeper, a pattern emerged. It wasn't about compensation or perks. The organization was strong in some areasâ€”innovation, growth targets, financial performanceâ€”but completely neglecting others: psychological safety, belonging, and meaning...`;

But organizations aren't pyramids. They're engines.

2/ Think about an engine with 7 cylinders. What happens if one fails? The entire engine loses power, no matter how strong the other 6 are.

3/ Same with organizations. You can't have:
- Innovation without psychological safety
- Performance without meaning
- Growth without integrity`;

5. Integrity & Justice (Justice and Accountability)
6. Wisdom & Compassion (Mercy and Knowledge)
7. Transcendence & Unity (Unity of Being)

Here's what makes this approach different:

â€¢ Interdependent: Weakness in one undermines all
â€¢ Measurable: Data-driven assessment
â€¢ Actionable: Specific interventions`;

Trust-Building Journey:

Step 1: CONNECT (Monday)
  - Personal story creates emotional connection
  - Universal pain point (talent retention)
  - No selling, just sharing insight
  
Step 2: EDUCATE (Wednesday)  
  - Explain revolutionary concept (cylinders vs levels)
  - Use memorable metaphor (engine)
  - Provide concrete examples with costs
  
Step 3: INTRODUCE (Friday)
  - Present complete framework
  - Set expectations for journey
  - Invite self-assessment

Result: Audience is emotionally connected, conceptually prepared, 
        and eager for the deep dives in Weeks 2-8.

Friday: "Which cylinder does your organization struggle with most?"
  Purpose: Gather data for Week 2-8 prioritization

These questions serve dual purpose:
1. Increase engagement metrics
2. Gather intelligence for content optimization
