Thread: Why we use "cylinders" not "levels" in organizational development

1/ Traditional organizational models use hierarchies: Maslow's pyramid, maturity levels, growth stages. 

But organizations aren't pyramids. They're engines.

2/ Think about an engine with 7 cylinders. What happens if one fails? The entire engine loses power, no matter how strong the other 6 are.

3/ Same with organizations. You can't have:
- Innovation without psychological safety
- Performance without meaning
- Growth without integrity

They're interdependent, not sequential.

4/ The old model says: "First survive, then thrive, then transcend."

Reality says: "Organizations need safety AND growth AND meaning simultaneously."

5/ Example: A tech startup focused only on growth (Cylinder 3) while ignoring belonging (Cylinder 2) lost 67% of their team in one year.

Cost of replacement: $2.3M

6/ Another example: A 100-year-old manufacturer perfected safety and stability (Cylinder 1) but neglected innovation (Cylinder 4).

Market share dropped 40% in 3 years.

7/ The Mizan Framework identifies 7 critical cylinders:
- Not steps to climb
- Not stages to pass through
- But elements that must ALL function for organizational health

8/ This week, we're exploring how this non-hierarchical approach transforms how we think about organizational development.

Ready to stop climbing and start strengthening?
