The 7 Cylinders: A Complete Framework for Organizational Health

After sharing my story Monday and explaining our cylindrical (not hierarchical) approach Wednesday, let me introduce the complete framework.

The Mizan Framework consists of 7 interdependent cylinders, each with its own ethical principle:

1. Safety & Survival (Preservation of Life)
   The foundation of trust—physical, psychological, and economic security

2. Belonging & Loyalty (Human Dignity)  
   Genuine connection and shared identity that creates commitment

3. Growth & Achievement (Striving with Excellence)
   The drive for mastery and performance balanced with humility

4. Meaning & Contribution (Service)
   Connecting individual work to collective purpose and impact

5. Integrity & Justice (Justice and Accountability)
   The bedrock of trust through fairness and ethical consistency

6. Wisdom & Compassion (Mercy and Knowledge)
   Leadership that balances analytical and emotional intelligence

7. Transcendence & Unity (Unity of Being)
   Achieving harmony between individual, team, and organizational purpose

Here's what makes this approach different:

• Non-Sequential: You don't master Cylinder 1 before moving to 2. They all matter now.

• Interdependent: Weakness in one cylinder undermines all others.

• Measurable: Each cylinder can be assessed through data-driven analysis.

• Actionable: Specific interventions can strengthen each cylinder.

Over the next 7 weeks, we'll explore each cylinder in depth:
- Week 2: Safety & Survival
- Week 3: Belonging & Loyalty  
- Week 4: Growth & Achievement
- Week 5: Meaning & Contribution
- Week 6: Integrity & Justice
- Week 7: Wisdom & Compassion
- Week 8: Transcendence & Unity

But here's my question for you:

Looking at these 7 cylinders, which one do you think your organization struggles with most? And which one does it excel at?

The answers might surprise you. They surprised us.

Next week, we dive deep into Cylinder 1: Safety & Survival—and why it's not just about physical safety anymore.
