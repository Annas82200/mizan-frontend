### Step 1: Login to Mizan Dashboard

1. Navigate to: `https://www.mizan.work/login`
2. Login with superadmin credentials:
   - Email: `anna@mizan.com`
   - Password: [Your password]

### Step 2: Navigate to Culture Assessment

1. From the sidebar, click **"Culture"** (under Modules section)
2. You should see the Culture Analysis dashboard
3. URL should be: `https://www.mizan.work/dashboard/superadmin/culture`

### Step 3: View Individual Employees Tab

1. On the Culture Analysis page, look for tabs at the top
2. Click the **"Individual Employees"** tab
3. You should see a list of employees with their survey completion status

### Step 4: Find Marcus Evans (or any employee marked "Completed")

1. Look for **Marcus Evans** in the employee list
2. His status should show **"Completed"** with a green checkmark ✓
3. Click on his row or click **"View Report"** button

### Step 5: Review the Generated Report

**What to Check:**

#### A. Cylinder Mapping Section
- [ ] Does the report show which cylinders the employee's values belong to?
- [ ] Are cylinders numbered 1-7?
- [ ] Format: "Cylinder X: [Name]" (e.g., "Cylinder 1: Safety & Survival")

#### B. Alignment Analysis (NOT Gap Analysis)
- [ ] Does it say things like:
  - ✅ "Your values beautifully align with..."
  - ✅ "You share X core values..."
  - ✅ "Your [specific value name] aligns with..."
- [ ] Does it AVOID negative language like:
  - ❌ "You lack..."
  - ❌ "Gap in..."
  - ❌ "You don't value..."

#### C. Personalized Recommendations
- [ ] Do recommendations reference SPECIFIC value names?
  - Example: "Given your **Courage** and **Integrity** values, you could..."
  - NOT generic: "Given your values, you could..."
- [ ] Are there 3-5 actionable recommendations?
- [ ] Do recommendations feel personal, not generic?

#### D. Reflection Questions
- [ ] Are there 3 open-ended reflection questions?
- [ ] Are they thoughtful and relevant to the employee's values?

### Step 6: Test the Regenerate Button

1. **Find the Regenerate Button**:
   - Should be near the "Completed" badge
   - Icon: Refresh/circular arrow icon
   - On hover: Should rotate smoothly

2. **Click the Regenerate Button**:
   - Click the button
   - You should see a loading indicator
   - Message: "Regenerating report... This will take 10-15 seconds"

3. **Wait for Regeneration**:
   - Wait approximately 10-15 seconds
   - Page should automatically refresh or show new content
   - If not automatic, manually refresh the page

4. **Review the NEW Report**:
   - [ ] Is the content different from before?
   - [ ] Does it still include all required sections?
   - [ ] Are the cylinder mappings still correct?
   - [ ] Are personalized recommendations updated?

### Step 7: Test with Another Employee (Optional)

Repeat Steps 4-6 with:
- **Olivia Brooks** or **Jenna Lee**
- Verify consistency across different employees
