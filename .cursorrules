# Mizan Platform Development Rules

## CRITICAL: Read AGENT_CONTEXT.md First
Before making ANY code changes, read scripts/agents/AGENT_CONTEXT.md

## Mandatory Requirements
1. NO MOCK DATA - Always use real database queries with Drizzle ORM
2. NO PLACEHOLDERS - No TODOs, FIXMEs, or incomplete implementations
3. NO 'any' TYPES - Use strict TypeScript types always
4. DRIZZLE ORM ONLY - Never use Prisma, TypeORM, or raw SQL
5. NEXT.JS APP ROUTER - Use App Router patterns, not Pages Router

## Design Guidelines
- Follow Tailwind CSS patterns from AGENT_CONTEXT.md
- Use design tokens: primary (#2563eb), success (#10b981), error (#ef4444)
- Maintain responsive design: sm:640px, md:768px, lg:1024px
- Include proper focus states for accessibility

## Architecture
- AI Agents MUST use Three-Engine Architecture (Knowledge, Data, Reasoning)
- Always include tenant isolation in database queries
- Add authentication checks on all protected routes
- Use proper error handling with try/catch

## File Paths
- Use paths relative to project root: frontend/src/..., backend/...
- Frontend files in frontend/src/
- Backend files in backend/

## Deployment
- Frontend deploys to Vercel automatically
- Backend deploys to Railway automatically
- Test locally before pushing

## Before Committing
Run the multi-agent audit system:
```bash
node scripts/orchestrator.js --dry-run
