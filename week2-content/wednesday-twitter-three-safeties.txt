Thread: Something I keep noticing about "safe" workplaces

1/ I've been in about 40 different organizations over the past few years. The ones with the best safety records often have the worst retention.

And I think I finally understand why.

2/ Most companies define safety as "nobody gets physically hurt."

They count injuries. Track incidents. Run drills.

All important. But incomplete.

3/ I kept asking people who quit "safe" companies why they left. The answers were never about physical danger.

They were about fear. Just different kinds.

4/ One engineer told me: "I'd rather risk getting hurt than risk looking stupid."

She left a company with zero safety violations because she was terrified to ask questions.

5/ Another guy took a 15% pay cut to leave a "stable" company.

Why? They kept denying layoff rumors while quietly eliminating positions. He couldn't plan his life.

6/ So here's my working theory (still testing this):

Safety has three layers:
- Physical (can I avoid bodily harm?)
- Psychological (can I avoid social harm?)
- Economic (can I avoid financial instability?)

7/ Companies that only optimize layer one end up with:
- Perfect compliance records
- People too scared to report near-misses
- Innovation dying because risk feels dangerous
- Talent bleeding out slowly

8/ I don't have a perfect solution yet. Still figuring out how to measure psychological and economic safety without turning it into another compliance checkbox.

But I'm convinced: if people don't feel safe in all three ways, they're not actually safe.

What am I missing?
