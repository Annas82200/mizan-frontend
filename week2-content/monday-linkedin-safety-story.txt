The Safety Audit That Fooled Everyone (Including Me)

I walked into that manufacturing facility expecting to find obvious problems. Instead, I found a safety program that would make any compliance officer proud.

Their Chief People Officer showed me around with justified confidence:
- 1,247 days without a workplace injury
- Monthly safety trainings, perfectly documented
- Color-coded hazard zones, emergency protocols posted everywhere
- Recent OSHA audit: zero violations

"So why are you here?" I asked.

She handed me an exit interview file. Twelve engineers had quit in the past six months. Not to competitors. To completely different industries. Some took pay cuts to leave.

I started reading the interviews. Nobody mentioned safety. But three phrases kept appearing:

"I stopped asking questions after the second meeting."
"One bug in production and you're basically done here."
"I couldn't predict if I'd have a job in three months."

That's when I realized I was looking for the wrong kind of safety.

Their physical safety was exemplary. But I watched a senior engineer stay silent in a meeting when he clearly disagreed with a technical decision. I saw a junior developer google something basic rather than ask her team lead. I heard hushed conversations about rumored layoffs that leadership denied but never actually addressed.

They had spent years perfecting physical safety while accidentally creating an environment where:
- Questions felt like admissions of incompetence
- Mistakes became career-limiting moves
- Financial stability was a month-to-month guess

The really uncomfortable part? I had done the same thing at my previous company. I had run the safety committee, tracked incident rates religiously, and completely missed that half my team was afraid to admit they were struggling.

This isn't a success story where I swooped in and fixed everything. It's messier than that. But it did teach me that "safety" means three completely different things:

Can you work without getting hurt?
Can you speak without getting punished?
Can you plan your life without constant financial anxiety?

Most organizations nail the first one and wonder why people still leave.

I'm still learning how to measure the other two. But I'm certain of this: you can have the safest workplace in America and still have people who don't feel safe at all.

Anyone else ever been blindsided by what you weren't measuring?
