What We're Learning About Safety (And What Still Puzzles Me)

After Monday's story about the manufacturing facility and Wednesday's thread about the three types of safety, a bunch of you asked for the practical stuff: "How do you actually measure this?"

Honest answer: We're still figuring it out. But here's what's working so far.

Physical Safety - This One's Easy (Relatively)

We all know how to track this:
- Injury rates
- Near-miss reports
- Workplace hazard assessments
- Health program participation

The tricky part isn't measurement. It's interpretation. If you have zero reported incidents, that's either really good or really bad. Depends on whether people trust the reporting system.

One company I worked with had "zero incidents" for three years. Turns out people were reporting to their managers who were quietly fixing things to avoid looking bad in safety meetings. The CEO had no idea how many close calls were happening.

Psychological Safety - This One's Harder

I've tried a bunch of approaches. Some worked. Some didn't.

What doesn't work:
- Annual surveys asking "Do you feel safe speaking up?" (People don't answer honestly)
- Counting "ideas submitted" (Doesn't tell you about fear, just productivity)

What seems to work better:
- Time between error and disclosure (faster = safer)
- Ratio of questions asked in meetings to assertions made
- Upward feedback participation (anonymous and acted upon)
- Measuring silence (literally tracking when meetings go quiet after leadership speaks)

Still not perfect. But it's directional.

Economic Safety - This One Nobody Talks About

This is the one that surprised me most. It's not about how much you pay people. It's about predictability.

Questions I ask leaders:
- Can your employees predict their take-home pay three months from now?
- When did you last announce a restructure? How much advance notice did people get?
- Do you share financial health transparently or just say "we're doing fine"?
- How many times have promised raises been delayed?

One organization we worked with paid well but changed bonus structures three times in 18 months. Their turnover was 31%. Not because people weren't paid enough. Because they couldn't plan their lives.

After they committed to 12-month bonus structure stability and quarterly financial transparency, turnover dropped to 18% over six months. They didn't increase compensation. They increased predictability.

The Part I'm Still Wrestling With

Here's what I don't have figured out yet:

Can you have high psychological safety and low performance standards? (I think no, but proving it is hard)

Does economic safety mean no layoffs ever? (Obviously not, but where's the line?)

How do you measure psychological safety in remote teams where you can't observe meeting dynamics?

Is it possible to have too much safety? (Can you make people so comfortable they stop growing?)

What I Think I Know

Based on working with about 15 organizations trying to improve all three dimensions:

1. You can't fake this with surveys and programs. People know whether they feel safe.

2. Physical safety is necessary but not sufficient. You need all three.

3. Leadership modeling matters more than policies. If the CEO doesn't admit mistakes, nobody else will.

4. Economic safety is about transparency and honoring commitments, not unlimited job security.

5. Most organizations are better at one dimension than the others. The weak one is usually the problem.

One More Thing

The organization from Monday's story? The manufacturing facility with perfect physical safety and terrible retention?

They started weekly transparent financial updates. They implemented "safe to fail" pilot projects. They committed to 90-day notice for any role changes.

Six months later: Turnover went from 26% to 14%. Not zero. But better. And honestly, some of the people who left probably should have. The difference is now people are leaving for opportunity, not fear.

They're still working on it. So am I.

If you're trying to figure this out too, what's your biggest challenge? Where do you get stuck?

Next week: Why "culture fit" might be the most dangerous phrase in modern HR. (Spoiler: It's about Cylinder 2â€”Belonging & Loyalty)
