### Option 2: Test via API (For Developers)

#### Step 1: Get Auth Token

```bash
curl -X POST https://mizan-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "anna@mizan.com",
    "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD"
  }'
```

Save the `token` from the response.

#### Step 2: Generate Content

```bash
curl -X POST https://mizan-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/social-media/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "platform": "linkedin",
    "contentPillar": "framework-education",
    "topic": "Cylinder 1: Safety & Survival - The Foundation of Organizational Culture",
    "targetAudience": "HR leaders and business owners",
    "includeVisuals": true
  }'
```

#### Step 3: Generate Weekly Batch

## ‚ùì **FAQ**

### Q: Do I need to review AI-generated content before posting?
**A**: YES. Always review and edit content to:
- Ensure accuracy
- Add personal touches
- Adjust tone if needed
- Verify facts and statistics

### Q: Can I edit the generated content?
**A**: Absolutely! The AI provides a strong foundation, but you should customize it for your voice and audience.

### Q: What if I want to post to multiple platforms?
**A**: Generate content once, then use the platform selector to regenerate optimized versions for each platform.

### Q: How often should I post?
**A**: Recommended schedule:
- LinkedIn: 3x per week (Mon, Wed, Fri)
- Twitter: Daily (threads on key topics)
- Instagram: 2-3x per week
- Medium: 1x per week (long-form deep dives)

### Q: Can I schedule posts in advance?
**A**: Currently, posts are immediate. For scheduling, you can:
1. Use LinkedIn's native scheduler
2. Integrate with Buffer (already built into frontend)
3. We can add a scheduling system to Mizan

### Q: Is LinkedIn OAuth secure?
**A**: Yes. OAuth 2.0 is the industry standard for secure authorization. Mizan:
- Never stores your LinkedIn password
- Uses short-lived access tokens
- Only requests minimum required permissions
- Tokens expire after 60 days

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### Issue: "LinkedIn access token not configured"
**Solution**: Complete Step 3 of OAuth setup (add environment variables to Railway)

### Issue: "Failed to post to LinkedIn"
**Solution**:
- Check if your access token has expired (60-day limit)
- Re-authorize the app
- Verify OAuth scopes include `w_member_social`

### Issue: "Content generation failed"
**Solution**:
- Check if AI provider API keys are configured in Railway
- Try again (temporary API rate limits)
- Check backend logs for specific error

### Issue: "Generated content is too long for platform"
**Solution**:
- The AI should automatically respect character limits
- If not, manually edit or regenerate with a shorter topic
