## 🗑️ DELETED COMPONENTS

### 1. Performance Analysis Module
**Deleted Files:**
- ❌ `backend/services/agents/performance/` (entire directory)
  - `goal-setter.ts`
  - `performance-analyzer.ts`
  - `performance-coach.ts`
  - `coaching-frameworks.ts`
  - `performance-agent.ts`
  - `__tests__/` (all test files)
- ❌ `backend/services/agents/performance-agent.ts`
- ❌ `backend/services/modules/performance/` (entire directory)
- ❌ `backend/config/performance.ts`

**Rationale:** Removed detailed performance analysis agents and complex reporting. Basic performance_reviews table and simple superadmin dashboard view preserved.

### 2. Skills Analysis Module
**Deleted Files:**
- ❌ `backend/services/agents/skills/skills-agent.ts`
- ❌ `backend/services/agents/skills-agent.ts`
- ❌ `backend/services/agents/skills/` (entire directory)
- ❌ `backend/routes/skills-analysis.ts`
- ❌ `frontend/src/app/dashboard/superadmin/skills/page.tsx`

**Rationale:** Skills analysis was not a core differentiator. Focus shifted to Culture & Structure.

### 3. Hiring/Recruitment Module
**Deleted Files:**
- ❌ `backend/services/agents/hiring/` (entire directory)
  - `candidate-assessor.ts`
  - `recruitment-strategist.ts`

**Deleted Files:**
- ❌ `backend/services/agents/recognition/recognition-agent.ts`
- ❌ `backend/services/agents/recognition-agent.ts`
- ❌ `backend/services/agents/recognition/` (entire directory)

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### Database Tables (NOT DELETED)
Per instructions, database tables were NOT deleted, only the application code managing them was removed. The following tables remain in the database but are no longer actively managed:
- `hiring_requisitions`
- `candidates`
- `interviews`
- `offers`
- `skills_assessments`
- `learning_paths`
- Other module-specific tables

### Mizan Development Rules Maintained
- ✅ No placeholders or mock data
- ✅ No 'any' types (existing ones preserved, none added)
- ✅ Drizzle ORM patterns maintained
- ✅ Tenant isolation preserved in all remaining code
- ✅ Three-engine pattern intact

### Breaking Changes to Watch For:
1. **Frontend Navigation**: Any navigation links to deleted pages (hiring, skills, lxp, social-media) will 404
2. **API Calls**: Frontend code calling deleted endpoints will fail
3. **Agent Manager**: Only accepts 'culture' and 'structure' as valid agent types
4. **Imports**: Any remaining files importing deleted agents will break (should be caught by TypeScript)

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### Functionality Verification Needed:
- [ ] Culture analysis end-to-end flow works
- [ ] Structure analysis end-to-end flow works
- [ ] Superadmin dashboard loads and displays correctly
- [ ] Three engines (Knowledge, Data, Reasoning) properly integrated in remaining agents
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] No broken imports in remaining code
- [ ] Orchestrator system (`scripts/orchestrator.js`) remains functional
- [ ] Authentication and tenant isolation still work
- [ ] All remaining routes are accessible

### Testing Recommendations:
1. Run TypeScript compiler: `cd backend && npm run build`
2. Check for linter errors: `npm run lint`
3. Test culture analysis endpoint: `POST /api/agents/culture/assess`
4. Test structure analysis endpoint: `POST /api/agents/structure/analyze`
5. Load superadmin dashboard in browser
6. Verify orchestrator can still run: `node scripts/orchestrator.js`
7. Test remaining API routes with Postman/curl
