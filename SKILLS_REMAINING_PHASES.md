## Total Remaining Work Summary

### Time Estimates

| Phase | Estimated Hours | Priority | Dependencies |
|-------|----------------|----------|--------------|
| Phase 3.2: Component Deep Integration | 19-25 hours | HIGH | Phase 3.1 ✅ |
| Phase 4: Module Integrations | 16-20 hours | MEDIUM | Phase 3.2, Other modules |
| Phase 5: Advanced Features | 25-31 hours | LOW | Phase 3.2 + 4 |
| **TOTAL** | **60-76 hours** | - | - |

### Critical Path

**Week 1** (Phase 3.2):
- Day 1-2: Workflow Manager + Framework Manager (5-7 hours)
- Day 3-4: Individual Assessment + Gap Analysis (7-9 hours)
- Day 5: Reporting + Progress Tracking (6-9 hours)

**Week 2-3** (Phase 4):
- Day 6-7: LXP Integration (5-6 hours)
- Day 8-9: Performance + Talent Integration (8-10 hours)
- Day 10: Compensation Integration (3-4 hours)

**Week 4-6** (Phase 5):
- Day 11-12: Database Optimization + Export (9-11 hours)
- Day 13-14: Advanced Analytics (6-7 hours)
- Day 15-18: Predictive Insights (8-10 hours)
- Day 19: Mobile Enhancements (2-3 hours)

### Risk Factors

1. **Module Dependencies**: Phase 4 requires other modules (LXP, Performance, Talent, Compensation) to be operational. If these modules are not ready, Phase 4 will be blocked.

2. **Backend Gaps**: Progress Tracking endpoints don't exist yet (Phase 3.2). Framework edit/delete endpoints don't exist (Phase 3.2).

3. **AI Model Complexity**: Predictive insights (Phase 5) require advanced machine learning models. This may require external expertise or longer development time.

4. **Database Scale**: If tenant has 10,000+ employees, queries may become slow without optimization (Phase 5). Consider doing database optimization earlier if scale is a concern.
