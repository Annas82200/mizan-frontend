# Mizan Platform - Final Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Auditor:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (DevOps Expert)

## 1. Executive Summary

This audit was conducted to verify the Mizan Platform's compliance with the standards and architecture defined in `AGENT_CONTEXT_ULTIMATE.md`.

The overall architecture is largely compliant. The core analysis modules (Structure, Culture, Skills) correctly implement the Three-Engine Architecture, use the specified technology stack (Drizzle ORM), and follow the documented inter-module trigger logic.

However, **two critical security and design flaws** were identified in the platform's multi-tenant implementation that violate fundamental compliance rules. These issues require immediate attention before the platform can be considered production-ready.

## 2. Overall Compliance Status

| Category | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **File Architecture** | ✅ **Compliant** | Frontend and backend file structures generally align with the documentation. |
| **Three-Engine Architecture** | ✅ **Compliant** | All audited agent services (`StructureAgentV2`, `CultureAgentV2`, `SkillsAgent`) correctly extend `ThreeEngineAgent` and implement the required analysis patterns. |
| **Module Triggering** | ✅ **Compliant** | The trigger logic between modules (e.g., Structure → Hiring, Culture → LXP/Performance, Skills → LXP) is correctly implemented by inserting records into the `triggers` table. |
| **Technology Stack** | ✅ **Compliant** | The backend consistently uses Drizzle ORM for database interactions. TypeScript and Zod are used for type safety and validation. |
| **Multi-Tenant Isolation** | ❌ **NON-COMPLIANT (CRITICAL)** | Significant vulnerabilities were found in the user authentication and payment processing logic that break tenant data isolation. |

## 3. Critical Findings & Recommendations

### Finding 1: `COMPLIANCE-01` - Global Uniqueness of User Emails

- **Severity**: **Critical**
- **Location**: `backend/src/db/schema/core.ts` (line 33), `backend/src/services/auth.ts` (lines 106, 142)
- **Description**: The `users` table schema enforces a global `UNIQUE` constraint on the `email` column. This is a fundamental design flaw in a multi-tenant system, as it prevents the same email address from being used across different tenants (e.g., an employee being part of two separate companies on the platform). The authentication service relies on this flawed constraint, looking up users by email alone without a tenant context during login.
- **Impact**: Prevents legitimate user registration scenarios and enforces a flawed data model that will cause significant issues as the platform scales.
- **Recommendation**:
    1.  **Modify Database Schema**: Remove the `unique()` constraint from the `email` column in the `users` table (`backend/src/db/schema/core.ts`).
    2.  **Enforce Composite Uniqueness**: Add a composite unique index/constraint on `(tenantId, email)` to ensure an email is unique only *within* a single tenant. This may require a new migration file.
    3.  **Update Login Flow**: The user interface for login must be updated to accept a tenant identifier (e.g., a company domain or name) in addition to email and password.
    4.  **Update Authentication Logic**: Modify the `login` function in `backend/src/services/auth.ts` to query the `users` table using **both `tenantId` and `email`**, ensuring the correct user is authenticated within their specific tenant.

### Finding 2: `COMPLIANCE-02` - Insecure Stripe Webhook Handlers

- **Severity**: **High**
- **Location**: `backend/src/services/stripe.ts` (lines 398-434)
- **Description**: The Stripe webhook handlers for `invoice.payment_succeeded` and `invoice.payment_failed` update payment records in the database using *only* the `stripePaymentIntentId` from the webhook event. They fail to include the `tenantId` (which is correctly retrieved from the event metadata) in the `WHERE` clause of the update query.
- **Impact**: While a collision of Stripe IDs is highly improbable, this pattern violates the "Always include `tenantId`" rule. It creates a potential vulnerability where a malformed or malicious webhook could theoretically update the payment status for the wrong tenant's record if an ID collision were ever to occur.
- **Recommendation**:
    1.  **Update Webhook Queries**: Modify the `db.update(payments)` calls inside the `handlePaymentSucceeded` and `handlePaymentFailed` functions in `backend/src/services/stripe.ts`.
    2.  **Add Tenant ID to Where Clause**: Ensure the `.where()` condition includes both the `stripePaymentIntentId` and the `tenantId` from the webhook metadata, using an `and()` operator. For example: `.where(and(eq(payments.stripePaymentIntentId, ...), eq(payments.tenantId, tenantId)))`.

## 4. Conclusion

The Mizan Platform's core AI and analysis logic is well-implemented and compliant with the architectural vision. However, the identified multi-tenancy flaws are critical and must be remediated immediately to ensure data integrity and security. Once these two findings are addressed, the platform will be in a much stronger position for production deployment.
